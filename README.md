# Smart-Genome-Sequencing

## Overview
Using Python Machine Learning libraries to automate Whole Genome Sequencing. This program will be able to parse a .fastq file and determine the outcome of any sequence based on CDC's previous analysis result.

## Technology Used:
- NumPY and Pandas to structure FastQ and internal data
- SciKit Learn to preprocess and extract machine learning models
